for detecting a cycle  we ues floyd tortoise and hare method

we will have one slow pointer and one fast pointer

we will increment fast pointer as fast = fast->next->next

where as we will increment slow pointer as slow = slow->next

if fast == slow at any pointer return true

or else if fast becomes NULL then return false

TO DETECT THE START OF A cycle

if fast == slow
    set slow to head
    then increment both and slow as slow = slow->next and fast = fast->next
    when slow == fast
        return slow/fast
